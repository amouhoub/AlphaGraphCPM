A graph editing tool that allows convertion of Minimal Potential Graphs to PERT graphs using a Critical Path Method (CPM)

This is another school project that I worked on during my 1st year of my Master Degree at University of Bordj Bou Arreridj - Algeria

This project has the crapiest code of all I wrote in my life :-). However, it is a successful implementation of a graph editing tool that allows to convert a graph that represents a project management (like a GANTT graph) into a PERT graph using a new CPM based approach
The implemented conversion algorithm is introduced in :
Mouhoub, N. E., Benhocine, A., & Belouadah, H. (2011). A new method for constructing a minimal PERT network. Applied Mathematical Modelling, 35(9), 4575-4588.

This code is very crappy as I said and needs a lot of cleansing effort to remove unused staff, comments, etc.

Feel free to contact me for any help ot further information
