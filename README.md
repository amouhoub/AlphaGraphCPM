AlphaGraphCPM
=============

A graph editing tool that allows convertion of Minimal Potential Graphs to PERT graphs using a Critical Path Method (CPM)

This is another school project that I worked on during my 1st year of my Master Degree at the University of Bordj Bou Arreridj - Algeria (2010)

This project has the crapiest code I ever wrote :-). However, it is a successful implementation of a graph editing tool that allows to convert a graph that represents a project management (like a GANTT graph) into a PERT graph using a new CPM based approach

The implemented conversion algorithm was later presented published in :
Mouhoub, N. E., Benhocine, A., & Belouadah, H. (2011). A new method for constructing a minimal PERT network. Applied Mathematical Modelling, 35(9), 4575-4588.

This code is very crappy as I said and needs a lot of cleansing effort to remove unused staff, comments, etc.

Feel free to contact me for any help ot further information
